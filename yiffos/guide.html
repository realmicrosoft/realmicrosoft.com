<p>first things first, you'll want to grab a copy of the latest yiffOS install image from
    everyone's favorite <a href="https://realmicrosoft.com">realmicrosoft.com</a>! this guide will
    be using v2.0.0 which can be downloaded <a href="/v2_yiffOS-installer.img">here</a>.

    <h3>using a virtual machine</h3>
    <p>if you're using a virtual machine for this install, you will need to mount the image somehow.
        qemu usually works fine with the install image, although you may need to disable secure boot.
        vmware, however, doesn't seem to like the image, and thus you may need to convert it to a
        vmware format image by running something like<br>
        <code>qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk v2_yiffOS-installer.img v2_yiffOS-installer.vmdk</code>
        <br>
        you may also want to resize the image to a larger size than 3GiB to fix a later issue,
        the process for doing so will not be covered here however as it varies between formats and
        vm programs</p>
</div>
<div id="using-pc">
    <h3>using a physical computer</h3>
    <p>if you're using a physical computer, you'll need to actually burn the image to a usb flash
        drive and boot off of that. the easiest way to do this is to first check which device is the
        flash drive by running <code>lsblk</code> and then writing the image using<br>
        <code>dd if=v2_yiffOS-installer.img of=/dev/sdX status=progress</code>
</div>

    once booted, you should see a screen that looks something like this:<br>
<div class="code-screenshot">

you may be tempted to follow the onscreen instructions, BUT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT STEPS YOU
SHOULD TAKE FIRST!!!!<br>
first of all, you'll need to download an updated install script as the one included with this
image is outdated and lacks some fixes that will be useful later.
you can download the version of the script that we will be using from
<a href="/install-yiffos.sh">https://realmicrosoft.com/install-yiffos.sh</a> by running<br>
<code>curl -O https://realmicrosoft.com/install-yiffos.sh</code><br>
or you can download the latest version from github by running<br>
<code>curl -O hhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/realmicrosoft/yiffOS-install-script/main/install-yiffos.sh</code><br>
(REMINDER THAT YOU ARE RUNNING THESE COMMANDS ON THE BOOTED YIFFOS INSTALLER IMAGE)<br>
<hr>
<h2>help! i have received an error stating i am out of disk space!</h2>
sooner or later, you'll get an error stating that you are out of disk space. this is
due to the small size of the yiffOS installer image. you'll need to resize the booted image
to the size of its enclosing media (either the usb flash drive or the actual .img file that your
vm is using). luckily, this is pretty simple and doesn't seem to cause issues from what i've seen.<br>
all you need to do is run <code>fdisk -l</code> and find the device that you want to resize, then
run <code>cfdisk /dev/sdX</code> to resize the partition, and then run
<code>resize2fs /dev/sdX</code> to resize the filesystem.<br>
after this, you'll just need to reboot and you should be good to go!<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
now that you've set up the new install script, you can go through the normal install process.<br>
first, you need to run <code>cfdisk</code> on the disk you want to install on. once here, you'll
need to create two partitions. one for the EFI partition and one for the root partition. you can
also optionally create a swap partition if you want to use it. the EFI partition should be 512MB
in size, and the root partition should be at least 3-4GB in size. the swap partition should be
equal to the size of your RAM.<br>
once done, you should have something like this:<br>
<div class="code-screenshot centre">
    Disk: /dev/sda<br>
    Size: 5.0 GB, whatever bytes, whatever sectors<br>
    Label: gpt, identifier: whatever-whatever-whatever<br>
    <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Device</td>
            <td>Start</td>
            <td>End</td>
            <td>Sectors</td>
            <td>Size</td>
            <td>Type</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/dev/sda1</td>
            <td>2048</td>
            <td>XXXXXXX</td>
            <td>XXXXXXX</td>
            <td>512M</td>
            <td>EFI System</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/dev/sda2</td>
            <td>XXXXXXX</td>
            <td>XXXXXXX</td>
            <td>XXXXXXX</td>
            <td>5G</td>
            <td>Linux filesystem</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="boxed left">
        Partition UUID: whatever-whatever-whatever<br>
        Partition type: whatever<br>
        Filesystem UUID: whatever-whatever<br>
        Filesystem: vfat<br>
        Mount point: /boot/efi<br>
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>[ Delete ]</td>
            <td>[ Resize ]</td>
            <td>[ Quit ]</td>
            <td>[ Type ]</td>
            <td>[ Help ]</td>
            <td>[ Write ]</td>
            <td>[ Dump ]</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
just hit the <code>Write</code> button and you should be good to go!<br>
after closing cfdisk, you'll need to run <code>mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdXX</code> on the EFI
partition in order to format it correctly. afterwards, you'll need to make a choice of which
filesystem you want to use on the root partition. we're going to be using btrfs as it is already
installed via the install script, however if you want to use another filesystem, you'll need
to install the appropriate package and then run <code>mkfs.whatever /dev/sdXX</code> on the root.
<br>ONE OTHER IMPORTANT STEP IF YOU'RE USING AN ALTERNATE FILESYSTEM:<br>
remember to also install the appropriate package for that filesystem <b>after</b> installing yiffOS!
after running the installer, you'll be inside a chroot, so you'll need to run <code>exit</code>
and then proceed to run<br>
<code>INSTALL_ROOT=/mnt/root bulge i &lt;appropriate package&gt;</code>
<hr>
anyways, assuming you're using btrfs, you can now run <code>mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdXX</code> to format
the root partition. if you get an error about another btrfs filesystem already existing, you can
just run <code>mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdXX</code> to overwrite it.<br>
<h3>now the fun part!</h3>
now that you've created and formatted your partitions, pretty much all you have left to do is
run<br>
<code>./install-yiffos.sh /dev/&lt;EFI PARTITION&gt; /dev/&lt;ROOT PARTITION&gt;</code><br>
and the installer will do almost all of the hard work for you!<br>
after you've run the installer, just wait a bit (or maybe a bit longer, depending on your
cpu and internet speed) and you'll be prompted to set a root password. make sure it's something
that you can remember for at least the next 10 minutes or so because you'll need it to log in
to your new yiffOS install. IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT REBOOT YET!!! we still have some work to do!<br>
(IF YOU PULLED FROM GITHUB, THIS IS FIXED!!!!)<br>
the install script has an issue in it that will cause dbus to not work, so we'll need to fix this.
luckily, it's a pretty simple fix, just run<br>
<div class="code-screenshot centre">
    rm /var/run/run<br>
    rm -R /var/run<br>
    ln -s /run /var/run<br>
</div>
(THE POSITIONING OF THE PARENTHESES IS VERY IMPORTANT!)<br>
you'll need to do one other thing however, which is to reinstall dbus as we kinda just deleted
it. this isn't too hard either though, you'll just need to exit the chroot (which hopefully you
were still inside for the previous commands) and then run<br>
<code>INSTALL_ROOT=/mnt/root bulge i dbus</code>
